# NTHU CS5422 Parallel Programming (2022 Fall)

## HW1: Odd-Even Sort

In this assignment, you are required to implement the odd-even sort algorithm using **MPI**.

## HW2: Mandelbrot Set

In this assignment, you are asked to parallelize the sequential MandelbrotSet program using **Pthread**, **OpenMP**, and **MPI**.

## HW3: All-Pairs Shortest Path

In this assignment, you are asked to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem with CPU threads and then further accelerate the program with CUDA accompanied by Blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
