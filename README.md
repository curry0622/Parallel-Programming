# NTHU CS5422 Parallel Programming (2022 Fall)

## HW1: Odd-Even Sort

In this assignment, you are required to implement the odd-even sort algorithm using **MPI**.

## HW2: Mandelbrot Set

In this assignment, you are asked to parallelize the sequential MandelbrotSet program using **Pthread**, **OpenMP**, and **MPI**.

## HW3: All-Pairs Shortest Path

In this assignment, you are asked to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem with CPU threads and then further accelerate the program with CUDA accompanied by Blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

## HW4: MapReduce

This assignment provides an opportunity for you to practice your parallel programming skills by implementing the scheduling and parallel programming model of the well-known big data processing framework, MapReduce.

## Final Project: Parallel Matrix Multiplication

[Vicky Chen](https://github.com/vickychen928) and I used several parallelism libraries, including SSE vectorization, Pthread, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA, to accelerate matrix multiplication. More information can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/curry0622/Parallel-Matrix-Multiplication).
